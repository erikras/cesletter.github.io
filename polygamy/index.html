Nothing was left to place on the altar save his life, his children, and his wife. Then came the Abrahamic test. Joseph demanded for himself what to Heber was the unthinkable, his Vilate. Totally crushed spiritually and emotionally, Heber touched neither food nor water for three days and three nights and continually sought confirmation and comfort from God. On the evening of the third day, some kind of assurance came, and Heber took Vilate to the upper room of Joseph's store on Water Street.

Joseph and Eliza had been married 3 months earlier, on June 29, 1842. Two Apostles and future prophets, John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff, were also aware of Joseph’s polygamy behind the scenes when they signed the affidavit. Another signer, Bishop Whitney, had personally married his daughter <a href="https://www.cesletter.org/polygamy/53" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Ann Whitney<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> to Joseph as a plural wife a few months earlier on July 27, 1842. Whitney’s wife and Sarah’s mother Elizabeth (also a signer) witnessed the ceremony.</p> <p>What does it say about Joseph Smith and his character to include his plural wife and associates – who knew about his secret polygamy/polyandry – to lie and perjure in a sworn public affidavit that Joseph was not a polygamist?</p> <p>Now, does the fact that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy and polyandry while denying and lying to Emma, the Saints, and the world over the course of 10+ years of his life prove that he was a false prophet? That the Church is false? No, it doesn’t.</p> <p>What it does prove, however, is that Joseph Smith’s pattern of behavior or modus operandi for a period of at least 10 years of his adult life was to keep secrets, to be deceptive, and to be dishonest – both privately and publicly.</p> <p>It’s when you take this snapshot of Joseph’s character and start looking into the Book of Abraham, the Kinderhook Plates, the Book of Mormon, the multiple First Vision accounts, Priesthood Restoration, and so on that you begin to see a very disturbing pattern and picture.</p> <p>Today, Warren Jeffs is more closely aligned to Joseph Smith’s Mormonism than the modern LDS Church is.</p> <div class="ImageWithCaption" data-v-5567a5b0><div class="title" data-v-5567a5b0>Joseph Smith vs. Warren Jeffs</div> <!----> <img src="/images/polygamy-joseph-vs-warren.jpg" data-v-5567a5b0> <!----> <div class="below" data-v-5567a5b0><em><em>Sources</em>: <a href="http://cesletter.org/polygamy/54">cesletter.org/polygamy/54</a></em></div></div> <div class="ImageWithCaption" data-v-5567a5b0><div class="title" data-v-5567a5b0>Joseph Smith's Polygamy | Polyandry</div> <!----> <img src="/images/polygamy-joseph-smith-polygamy.jpg" data-v-5567a5b0> <!----> <div class="below" data-v-5567a5b0><em><em>Sources</em>: <a href="http://cesletter.org/polygamy/55">cesletter.org/polygamy/55</a></em></div></div></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
