Jeremy Runnells was offered an opportunity to discuss his own doubts with a director of the Church Educational System (CES) and was assured that his doubts could be resolved. After reading Jeremy&#39;s letter, the director promised him a response. No response ever came.">

It all doesn’t matter. The Book of Mormon Witnesses and their testimonies of the gold plates are irrelevant. It does not matter whether eleven 19th century treasure diggers with magical worldviews saw some gold plates or not. It doesn’t matter because of this one simple fact:</p> <h4 id="joseph-did-not-use-the-gold-plates-for-translating-the-book-of-mormon" class="spaced-title text-center"><a href="#joseph-did-not-use-the-gold-plates-for-translating-the-book-of-mormon" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> JOSEPH DID NOT USE THE GOLD PLATES FOR TRANSLATING THE BOOK OF MORMON</h4> <p>The testimony of the Three and Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon is a key part to the testimonies of many members of the Church. Some even base their testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon on these 11 witnesses and their claims. As a missionary, I was instructed to teach investigators about the testimonies of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon as part of boosting the book’s credibility.</p> <p>There are several critical problems for relying and betting on these 19th century men as credible witnesses.</p> <h2 id="magical-worldview"><a href="#magical-worldview" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Magical Worldview</h2> <p>In order to truly understand the Book of Mormon witnesses and the issues with their claims, one must understand the magical worldview of many people in early 19th century New England. These are people who believed in folk magic, divining rods, visions, second sight, peep stones in hats, treasure hunting (money digging or glass looking), and so on.</p> <p>Many people believed in buried treasure, the ability to see spirits and their dwelling places within the local hills and elsewhere. This is one reason why treasure digging as a paid service was practiced. Joseph Smith, his father, and his brother Hyrum had engaged in treasure hunting from 1820–1827. Joseph was hired by folks like Josiah Stowell, who Joseph mentions in his <a href="https://cesletter.org/witnesses/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.

The Lord responded to his supplication by granting this revelation.</q> <!----> <!----></div> <p>The revelation states, in relevant part:</p> <div class="ScriptureQuote" data-v-b467521c><div class="reference" data-v-b467521c>D&amp;C 8:6-11</div> <div class="description" data-v-b467521c>(Emphasis Added)</div> <div class="scripture" data-v-b467521c>6.

7. Behold, there is no other power, save the power of God, that can cause this gift of Aaron to be with you.<div style="padding-top: 0.5rem;"></div>
8. Therefore, doubt not, <strong>for it is the gift of God; and you shall hold it in your hands</strong>, and <strong>do marvelous works</strong>; and no power shall be able to take it away out of your hands, <strong>for it is the work of God</strong>.<div style="padding-top: 0.5rem;"></div>
9. And, therefore, <strong>whatsoever you shall ask me to tell you by that means, that I will grant unto you</strong>, and you shall have knowledge concerning it.<div style="padding-top: 0.5rem;"></div>
10. Remember that <strong>without faith you can do nothing; therefore ask in faith</strong>. Trifle not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not.<div style="padding-top: 0.5rem;"></div>
11. Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, and <strong>that you may translate and receive knowledge from all those ancient records which have been hid up, that are sacred</strong>; and according to your faith shall it be done unto you.</div></div> <p>From the D&amp;C 8 account, we don’t really know much about what exactly the “gift of Aaron” is that Oliver Cowdery received. What is “the gift of Aaron”? The text provides several clues:</p> <ul><li>Oliver has a history of using it, since “it has told [him] many things.”</li> <li>It is “the gift of God.”</li> <li>It is to be held in Oliver’s hands (and kept there, impervious to any power).</li> <li>It allows Oliver to “do marvelous works.”</li> <li>It is “the work of God.”</li> <li>The Lord will speak through it to Oliver and tell him anything he asks while using it.</li> <li>It works through faith.</li> <li>It enables Oliver to translate ancient sacred documents.</li></ul> <p>With only these clues, the “gift of Aaron” is difficult to identify. The task becomes much easier, however, when we look at the original revelation contained in the Book of Commandments, a predecessor volume to the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, used by the LDS Church before 1835.

It is a divining rod or dowsing rod as illustrated in the above images, which Oliver Cowdery used to hunt for buried treasure.</p> <p>Cowdery’s use of a divining rod to search for buried treasure evokes similar images of Joseph Smith hunting for treasure with a peep stone in a hat. Oliver also wished to use his divining rod, in the same way Joseph Smith used his stone and hat, to translate ancient documents. Doctrine &amp; Covenants Section 8 indicates that the Lord, through Joseph Smith, granted Oliver’s request to translate using a...rod.</p> <p>If Oliver Cowdery’s gift was really the use of a divining rod – and it was – then this tells us that the origins of the Church are much more rooted in folk magic and superstition than we’ve been led to believe by the LDS Church’s whitewashing of its origins and history.</p> <h2 id="witnesses"><a href="#witnesses" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Witnesses</h2> <p>We are told that the witnesses never disavowed their testimonies, but we have not come to know these men or investigated what else they said about their experiences.</p> <p>They are 11 witnesses to the Book of Mormon: Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, David Whitmer, John Whitmer, Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer Jr., Hyrum Smith, Samuel Smith, and Joseph Smith Sr. – who all shared a common worldview of second sight, magic, and treasure digging – which is what drew them together in 1829.</p> <p>The following are several facts and observations on three of the Book of Mormon Witnesses:</p> <div class="ImageWithCaption" data-v-5567a5b0><!----> <!----> <img src="/images/witnesses-martin-harris.jpg" data-v-5567a5b0> <div class="title" data-v-5567a5b0>Martin Harris</div> <!----></div> <p>Martin Harris was anything but a skeptical witness.

Wheelan, James M. Van Nostrand, and Edward Whitcomb, assembled at the call of James J. Strang, who is by us and many others approved as a Prophet and Seer of God. He proceeded to inform us that it had been revealed to him in a vision that an account of an ancient people was buried in a hill south of White River bridge, near the east line of Walworth County; and leading us to an oak tree about one foot in diameter, told us that we would find it enclosed in a case of rude earthen ware under that tree at the depth of about three feet; requested us to dig it up, and charged us to so examine the ground that we should know we were not imposed upon, and that it had not been buried there since the tree grew. The tree was surrounded by a sward of deeply rooted grass, such as is usually found in the openings, and upon the most critical examination we could not discover any indication that it had ever been cut through or disturbed.<div style="padding-top: 0.5rem;"></div>
We then dug up the tree, and continued to dig to the depth of about three feet, where we found a case of slightly baked clay containing three plates of brass. On one side of one is a landscape view of the south end of Gardner’s prairie and the range of hills where they were dug. On another is a man with a crown on his head and a scepter in his hand, above is an eye before an upright line, below the sun and moon surrounded with twelve stars, at the bottom are twelve large stars from three of which pillars arise, and closely interspersed with them are seventy very small stars. The other four sides are very closely covered with what appear to be alphabetic characters, but in a language of which we have no knowledge.<div style="padding-top: 0.5rem;"></div>
The case was found imbedded in indurated clay so closely fitting it that it broke in taking out, and the earth below the soil was so hard as to be dug with difficulty even with a pickax. Over the case was found a flat stone about one foot wide each way and three inches thick, which appeared to have undergone the action of fire, and fell in pieces after a few minutes exposure to the air. The digging extended in the clay about eighteen inches, there being two kinds of earth of different color and appearance above it.<div style="padding-top: 0.5rem;"></div>
We examined as we dug all the way with the utmost care, and we say, with utmost confidence, that no part of the earth through which we dug exhibited any sign or indication that it had been moved or disturbed at any time previous. The roots of the tree stuck down on every side very closely, extending below the case, and closely interwoven with roots from other trees. None of them had been broken or cut away. No clay is found in the country like that of which the case is made.<div style="padding-top: 0.5rem;"></div>
In fine, we found an alphabetic and pictorial record, carefully cased up, buried deep in the earth, covered with a flat stone, with an oak tree one foot in diameter growing over it, with every evidence that the sense can give that it has lain there as long as that tree has been growing. Strang took no part in the digging, but kept entirely away from before the first blow was struck till after the plates were taken out of the case; and the sole inducement to our digging was our faith in his statement as a Prophet of the Lord that a record would thus and there be found.</q> <div class="below-quote" data-v-ec500b8a><em>AARON SMITH,<br>JIRAH B.

The Shakers had a sacred book entitled <em><a href="https://cesletter.org/witnesses/35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Holy, Sacred and Divine Roll and Book; From the Lord God of Heaven, to the Inhabitants of Earth<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em>.</p> <div class="ImageWithCaption" data-v-5567a5b0><!----> <!----> <img src="/images/witnesses-shakers.jpg" data-v-5567a5b0> <!----> <!----></div> <p>More than 60 individuals gave testimony to the <em>Sacred Roll and Book</em>, which was published in 1843.

The Shakers, however, had a large number of witnesses who claimed they saw angels and the Sacred Roll and Book. There are over a hundred pages of testimony from “Living Witnesses.” The evidence seems to show that Martin Harris accepted the Sacred Roll and Book as a divine revelation. Clark Braden stated: “Harris declared repeatedly that he had as much evidence for a Shaker book he had as for the Book of Mormon” (The Braden and Kelly Debate, p.173).</p> <p>Why should we believe the Book of Mormon Witnesses but not the Shakers witnesses? What are we to make of the reported Martin Harris comment that he had as much evidence for the Shaker book he had as for the Book of Mormon?</p> <hr class="divider"> <p>In light of the James Strang/Voree Plates witnesses, the fact that all of the Book of Mormon Witnesses – except Martin Harris – were related to either Joseph Smith or David Whitmer, along with the fact that all of the witnesses were treasure hunters who believed in second sight, and in light of their superstitions and reputations...why would anyone gamble their lives by believing in a book based on anything these men said or claimed, or what’s written as the testimonies of the Witnesses in the preface of the Book of Mormon?</p> <p>The mistake that is made by 21st century Mormons is that they’re seeing the Book of Mormon Witnesses as empirical, rational, nineteenth-century men instead of the nineteenth-century magical thinking, superstitious, inconsistent, and treasure digging men they were. They have ignored the peculiarities of their worldview, and by so doing, they misunderstand their experiences as witnesses.</p> <p>At the end of the day? It all doesn’t matter. The Book of Mormon Witnesses and their testimonies of the gold plates are irrelevant. It does not matter whether eleven 19th century treasure diggers with magical worldviews saw some gold plates or not. It doesn’t matter because of this one simple fact:</p> <h4 id="joseph-did-not-use-the-gold-plates-for-translating-the-book-of-mormon-2" class="spaced-title text-center text-red"><a href="#joseph-did-not-use-the-gold-plates-for-translating-the-book-of-mormon-2" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> JOSEPH DID NOT USE THE GOLD PLATES FOR TRANSLATING THE BOOK OF MORMON</h4> <div class="ImageWithCaption" data-v-5567a5b0><!----> <!----> <img src="/images/witnesses-plates-hat.jpg" data-v-5567a5b0> <!----> <!----></div> <p><em>Ancient prophets go through all the time, trouble, and effort in making, engraving, compiling, abridging, preserving, transporting, hiding, and burying gold plates.</em></p> <p><em>Moroni dies and comes back as a resurrected angel to deliver the gold plates to Joseph for translating the Book of Mormon.</em></p> <p><em>Joseph uses his rock and hat instead for dictating the Book of Mormon we have today.</em></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
